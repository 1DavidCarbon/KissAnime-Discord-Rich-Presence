3. After you install both files, type this in Command Prompt (run as administrator). If you can't (or don't want to) use Command Prompt, you can just restart your computer. However, we recommend this method as it's faster.

```batch
net start KADRP
```

## Installing the XPI file (only works in Firefox 4 and above)
1. Open Firefox and press CTRL + Shift + A.

2. Press the little gear icon in the right and select 'Install Add-on From File...'.
