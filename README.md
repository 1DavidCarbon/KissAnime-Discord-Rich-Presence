## Installation
1. Download and install the latest version of the browser extension (only Firefox is supported at the moment).

2. Download and install the latest release of the WebSocket server [here](https://github.com/AnjoEscuro/KissAnime-Discord-Rich-Presence/releases).

3. Open Command Prompt (as an administrator) and type this. If you can't (or don't want to) meddle with Command Prompt, you can just restart your computer instead (easiest way is Command Prompt though)

```batch
net start KADRP
```

4. Now you can go to KissAnime and do your thing :smile:
